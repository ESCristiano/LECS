## Problem Statement

Sound, music, and lights can provide a pleasurable experience that makes people feel good.Nowadays, music and light effects are combined to provide audio-visual effects, with thousands of artists using this combination to provide pleasurable sensory experiences to their fans.The effective use of this combination of effects is also a very profitable area.

Merging music and lights is increasingly more important in entertainment, namely live performances, since using light effects can improve music lovers experiences, as such light effects play an important part in the audio-visual world. With this in mind, the main idea is to create a system to control light and some effects. The effects are applied to the light and are controlled through a set of gestures.

A three-dimensional figure will be chosen to take a structure with depth, and this way it is
possible to create 3D effects that can be reproduced using an three-dimensional LED matrix.
The system must feature two operation modes:

  • Auto-adjust mode: this mode adapts the lights effects to the music style.
  • Manual mode: when the user performs some special movements with his hand in a specific area,the light effects change accordingly.
  
This effects can adjust to the sound based on the bass and treble (low and high) frequencies To capture the sound waves it’s be based on a microphone. Other important characteristic is the systems’ robustness, because this system goes from show
after show, it should tolerate a lot of displacements and a few impacts.
